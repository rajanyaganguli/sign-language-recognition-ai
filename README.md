![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-Web%20App-FF4B4B)

A real-time hand gesture recognition system built using *MediaPipe, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Streamlit*. The application detects hand landmarks from webcam input, extracts geometric features, and predicts gestures using a custom-trained neural network. The entire pipeline runs efficiently on CPU, enabling low-latency inference without requiring cloud services.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎥 Real-time gesture recognition using webcam input
* ✋ Hand landmark detection using MediaPipe
* 🧠 Custom GestureNet (MLP) classifier built with PyTorch
* 🌐 Interactive Streamlit web application
* 🖼️ Supports both live webcam and image-based inference
* ⚡ Lightweight CPU-based inference for fast predictions

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Traditional image-based gesture recognition often requires large datasets and computationally expensive CNN architectures. This project leverages *MediaPipe's 21-point hand landmark detector* to obtain compact representations of hand poses.

The extracted landmark coordinates are normalized and used to train a lightweight *GestureNet Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)* capable of recognizing gestures in real time.
